# PHP - Linked Data Application 

This is the code repository for a Linked Data PHP application built for a university project and incorperates Chart.js

The hosted application can be viewed [here](http://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/COMP2001/jwhiteford/public/index.php).

The application takes the [Nature Reserves datset](https://plymouth.thedata.place/dataset/local-nature-reserves) provided by Data Place Plymouth and adds graphing to aid in the understanding of the data.  This can be viewed [here](http://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/COMP2001/jwhiteford/public/dataSet.php).

An RDF output for the dataset is also provided [here](http://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/COMP2001/jwhiteford/natureReserve/index.php).
